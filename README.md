Since I am not comfortable with coding and was always hesitent to learn about automation. I had an assumption that we need to be master in coding inorder to start the career in automation.

Finally, ZAPTEST proved it wrong and they have introduced a tool for everyone.Anybody can do automation provided you have coding experience or not. For the coders they have UI Scripted and for non coders they have UI Script-Less.
