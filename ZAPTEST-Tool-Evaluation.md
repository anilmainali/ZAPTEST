## Evaluation Criteria

1. Test case management capabilities
2. Object recognition capabilities
3. Recording capabilities across browsers
4. Platforms (OS support)

```
on which platforms does the tool being evaluated run? Platforms can be Windows, MacOS, Unix, Linux, Web, Mobile, etc. Some     tools such as Selenium and Maveryx support multiple platforms, while others like Ranorex run mainly on Windows.
```

5. Cross browser playback
6. Parallel execution (Multiple Suites)
7. Run suites across cloud
8. Run suites across secure environments
9. Headless test execution support
10. Scripting language dependency

```
many tools support only a certain programming language used to write the AUT. For example, Abbot and Maveryx are used for testing Java applications. Many other tools like TestComplete and Ranorex can work with any languages used in the AUT provided that it can run on supported platforms.
```
10. Debugging capabilities
11. Test data integration capabilities
12. Crash & recovery capabilities
13. Operational performance 
14. Technical support
15. Depth of help contents (Internal)
16. Depth of help contents (External)
17. Localization support
18. Integration with CI/CD tools (Jenkins)
19. Reports - Email
20. Reports - PDF
21. Reports - Jira Integration
22. Reports - Slack Integration
23. Dashboard with analytics

24. Advantages over Selenium ?
25. Support data-driven testing ?
26. Support keyword-driven testing ?
27. Support model based testing ?
28. Difference between free and paid versions ?
29. Support  Record/ playback
30. Performance testing support
31. Stress testing support
32. Others
33. Ease of installation
34. Ease of use
35. Time to find online help tips
36. Ease of scripting and reporting

37. Open source ?
38. Platform dependency ?
39. AUT programming languages
40, Scripting languages
```
which languages does the tool support for writing test scripts? Many automation testing tools provide flexible scripting options, allowing testing teams to write test scripts in their most favorable languages.
```

41. Support
42. Usability
43. Script maintainability
44. Level of programming expertise required (0-10) ?
45. Testing approaches
```
various approaches are introduced in existing automated testing tools on the market. Available tools follow one or many of the following:

Linear: procedural scripts executing step-by-step from the start to the end of a test case. The linear scripts are typically generated by the tool’s record feature.
Record/playback: tools have capabilities to record tests’ actions, generate test scripts, and playback test scripts automatically.

Structured: unlike linear, this approach allows scripts to include control structures such as “if-else” and loop (“for”, “while”).

Data-driven: the test execution flow is driven by data stored externally, in a database, spreadsheets or files.

Keyword-driven: the test execution flow is driven by keywords typically stored in tables mapping keywords and input data needed for the execution. Objects captured from the record and playback capabilities are used as keywords in many tools such as Katalon Studio, Selenium, Ranorex, and TestComplete.

Model-based: test procedures or scripts are automatically generated using requirements and behaviors model.

Hybrid: supporting two or more of the above. Most of existing tools provide this hybrid approach.
```

46. Pricing
```
Cost is an important factor in deciding which tool to use. You have to take into account both licensing and support costs. Some tools require no or nominal cost to acquire, but they incur a large sum of money spent to call for external support. Additional cost comes from training and spending extra effort for understanding and solving problems related to the tool.
