5. LOAD

Since I am not comfortable with coding and was always hesitant to learn about automation, I had an assumption that we need to be a master in coding to start my career in automation.

Finally, ZAPTEST proved it wrong, and they have introduced a tool for everyone. Anybody can do automation provided you have coding experience or not. For the coders, they have UI Scripted, and for non-coders, they have UI Script-Less.

Btw- you need to know JavaScript and for coders.

Now, let us start learning the ZAPTEST Tool by using the UI Script-Less approach. Let us follow the above tutorials.
